# Demo-Game

A game developed based on "Ender's Game" written in C++

In order to play enter 'make' in the command line 

Then enter ./beginGame

Problem to be solved:
1. 9 spaces were created that were linked to one another by 4 pointer variables  (Top,
    Bottom, Left, and Right). A space abstract class was used with special pure virtual
    functions to demonstrate use of polymorphism. 
2. I created 7 devived classes for my spaces that the player may intreract with as they
    traverse the game. The player is given health and an amount of moves needed to
    complete the game. 
3. A unit abstact class was used to create 2 derived classes; The player and the opponent.
    The user will have an inventory to store items but will have a limit to the number of i
     tems they may carry.    

Gameplay
The user is placed in a gaming environment where they must traverse through different
 spaces and interact with the location so that they may gather the items necessary to later
 enter the 'Hive Planet' and complete the game. The user will encounter various missions
as they enter the different spaces that they will need to complete in order to unlock the
special item from the location. At the beginning of the game they will be walked though a
training session so that they may understand the controls of the game. The player is given
25 health and is allotted with 50 moves in which they must finish the game.
